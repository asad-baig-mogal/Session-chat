# Session-Chat
Session-Chat allows you to join and create chat sessions. When someone creates a chat session, a unique 14 character key is created and this key should be shared with people who needs to join the chat session and people can join the chat session by entering that 14 character key. Once the admin(the person who created and joined the session first) ends the Chat Session then all messages and all other information related to that Chat Session gets deleted from the database.
